## Security and Privacy Measures

Both permissions are implemented with strict security protocols:

- **User Consent:** Explicit permission requests with clear explanations of why access is needed
- **Selective Access:** Users can choose specific images/videos rather than granting blanket access
- **No Background Access:** Permissions are only used when users actively initiate media-related actions
- **Data Protection:** All uploaded media is transmitted over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)
- **No Third-Party Sharing:** User media is never shared with third parties beyond the educational platform
- **Temporary Storage:** Media files are cached temporarily and securely, with automatic cleanup

## Alternative Approaches Considered

We evaluated alternative approaches but found them insufficient for educational needs:

- **Camera Only:** Would require users to take new photos/videos every time, preventing use of existing educational content
- **File Picker:** Less intuitive user experience and doesn't integrate well with modern Android storage access
- **Cloud Storage Links:** Would require additional setup and could compromise user experience for offline scenarios

## Compliance with Google Play Policies

Our use of these permissions strictly adheres to Google Play policies:

- **Educational Purpose:** All media access serves legitimate educational functions
- **User Control:** Users maintain full control over which media to share and when
- **Transparent Usage:** Clear in-app explanations provided for each permission request
- **Minimal Access:** We request only the permissions essential for core educational functionality
- **No Advertising:** Media access is never used for advertising or marketing purposes
